# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
### A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested the completion of the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
### 1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
### 2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
### 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
### 4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
### 5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
### In this challenge we will import data from a csv file. We will become familiar with python by writing code with if, for, and f string statements after we create paths to pull our data and enable us to write data to a new file with our findings. 

## Challenge Summary
### In this challenge we took data from a csv file and imported it into Python. W then created paths to pull our data in and write our results out.  We set total votes to zero and set candidate options and candidate votes. We then created the winning candidate and winning candidate count tracker. Next, we opened the election results and read the file. We used if and for statements to generate our results before writing our findings to election analysis using f strings for the candidate summary.
